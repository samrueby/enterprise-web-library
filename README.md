## Introduction

[William Gross](http://wgross.net/) and Greg Smalter launched this project back in 2004, in closed-source form, as a “standard library” that would eliminate a lot of the duplication that existed across the various line-of-business web applications that they maintained for their clients. It was successful, and after steady improvement each year, they open-sourced the entire library in 2012. William has been the lead developer since then. EWL uses the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and is in production use at [several organizations](http://enterpriseweblibrary.org/usedby/).
